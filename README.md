# Speech-Summarization-with-Langchain-and-GPT-3.5-API-


### Overview
This project aims to automate the process of summarizing text documents using various text summarization techniques. The project utilizes Lang chain, an open-source library, and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to implement text summarization algorithms. By leveraging these technologies, the project facilitates the efficient extraction of key information from lengthy documents, aiding in tasks such as document understanding, information retrieval, and content analysis.


### Features
**Multiple Text Summarization Techniques:** The project incorporates several text summarization techniques, including basic prompt summarization, to cater to different use cases and requirements.<br />
**Integration with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Model:** Utilizes the powerful language model provided by OpenAI to generate accurate and coherent summaries.<br />
User-Friendly Interface: Designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to easily input text documents and receive concise summaries in return.<br />
**Scalability:** The project is scalable and can be extended to handle various document types and volumes, making it suitable for both small-scale tasks and enterprise-level applications.<br />
**Potential for Further Development:** Offers opportunities for further development, including enhancing summarization accuracy, optimizing performance, and integrating with other NLP (Natural Language Processing) tools and libraries.<br />
